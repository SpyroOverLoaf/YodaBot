<h1>The Yoda Bot</h1>

This python bot looks for comments that contain words such as "star wars", "yoda", and "luke skywalker", scrambles the comment, and replies to the original comment with the new comment.

To use, you must set up a reddit account and then go to Preferences - Apps and create a new script. Get the client id, client secret, username, and password and fill them into the script.
